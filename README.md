### Mandatory

* The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted.

* We have at our disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.

* Our goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program using Push_swap instruction language that sorts the integer arguments received.


#### Push_swap instruction language:

| Instruction | Description|
|:-:|-|
| **sa** | swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements). |
| **sb** | swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements). |
| **ss** | sa and sb at the same time. |
| **pa** | push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty. |
| **pb** | push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty. |
| **ra** | rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one. |
| **rb** | rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
| **rr** | ra and rb at the same time. |
| **rra** | reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one. |
| **rrb** | reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one. |
| **rrr** | rra and rrb at the same time. |
